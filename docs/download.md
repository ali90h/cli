# Download mode

HTTPie's `--download` option saves response bodies to files. When a server
returns a `Content-Encoding` (for example `gzip`), the `Content-Length` header
is treated as the size of the encoded payload as defined in RFC 9110 ยง 8.6.
HTTPie writes the body exactly as received and no longer compares the header to
the post-decompression size.
